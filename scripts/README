## 🧩 AJ Data Extraction

JMCore uses model and animation data generated by the **Animated Java** Blockbench plugin.

Because the plugin’s direct `.json` export is currently non-functional in recent versions, JMCore includes a data extraction script to process the exported **data pack** instead.
### 🧠 Overview

The script `extract-aj-data.py` is used to convert Animated Java data packs into a JMCore-compatible format.
### 📘 Usage

1. Export your Animated Java project as a data pack and resource pack.
2. Place the `extract-aj-data.py` script in the **top-level folder** of the exported data pack.
3. Run the script:

```bash

python3 extract-aj-data.py

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
4. The script will generate an `aj_data` folder inside the data pack’s root directory.
5. Move the generated `aj_data` folder into JMCore’s `resources` directory for use by the plugin.

### 📝 Notes

* Designed specifically for JMCore’s model and animation system.
* Keep the extraction script version aligned with the JMCore version you’re using.
* If you make changes to JMCore’s data format, update this script accordingly.
